I was involved in the design (but not execution) of this piece of analytics that involved fuzzy-joining datasets (police activity and camera metadata), statistical analysis and computational optimization. The result was the first calculation of an estimate of compliance with body-worn camera usage regulations.

The compliance rate was a key finding of the audit and was a milestone in demonstrating the utility of data science in performance audit at VAGO

[The report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/managing-body-worn-cameras) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 8 June 2022
