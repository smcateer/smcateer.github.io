In this audit, we used [data envelopment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_envelopment_analysis) to investigate the efficiencies of council libraries. The inputs included library FTE and collection size, and outputs included number of loans, opening hours and program attendance. We were able to draw conclustions about the relative efficiencies of library service delivery models.

[The report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/council-libraries) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General on 13 November 2019.
