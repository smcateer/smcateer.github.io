Not (see below) presented at IMPACT 2020 with Xiaoyan Lu (Australian National Audit Office)

Performance audit data science is still an emerging disclipline. The challenge for practicioners is to figure out what it *is* (while actually delivering results!)

Data sciene is more developed other areas are: reporting, decision support (incl. operations research), process improvement and product development. None of those paradigms quite fit the needs of performance audit.

In this presentation we discuss:
* The journey at both Victorian Auditor‐Generals Office (VAGO) and Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) – quite different!
* What we have learnt so far
* What we know we don’t know yet

Finally, this presentation is call to arms – help us figure it all out! Help us write the book on Data Science in Performance Audit!

(Unfortunately the IMPACT 2020 conference was cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, the presentation itself, and the presentations of some of the other speakers can be found [on the VAGO website](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/impact-2020).)
