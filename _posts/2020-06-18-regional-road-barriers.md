In this audit, we used Poisson modelling to evaluate the extent to which regional road barriers reduced fatalities and serious injuries. It was based on two datasets. Geospatial data on the location of the barriers (and their installation dates), and road crash data.

[The report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/safety-victorias-roads-regional-road-barriers) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 18 June 2020.
