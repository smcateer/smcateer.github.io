The data analytics in this audit used longitudinal student attendance and academic performance data to measure the effectiveness of the Navigator program using a natural experiment that was provided by the staged rollout of the program. The analysis was able to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of the program at achieving its stated goals.

[The report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/effectiveness-navigator-program?) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 23 March 2022.
