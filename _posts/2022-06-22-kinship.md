In a very challenging piece of analytics to work on, we looked at the compliance of the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing (DFFH) with regulations around child wellbeing. For details of the strong conclusions we drew, see [the full report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/kinship-care). The data work on this audit itself involved running metrics based on the regulations across the department's child protection data. 

During the course of the Kinship Care audit, we made more general observations on the quality of the data used by the department. We concluded that "DFFH does not have adequate controls to ensure its child protection data is of high quality." For details, see the [full repot](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/quality-child-protection-data). While it is difficult to make an assessment of data quality just be looking at the data itself, we did some analysis of outliers, missing data and data that did not make logical sense. The bulk of the analyis actually focussed on DFFH's processess and procedures.

[Kinship Care](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/kinship-care) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 22 June 2022 and [Quality of Child Protection Data](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/quality-child-protection-data) on 21 September 2022.
