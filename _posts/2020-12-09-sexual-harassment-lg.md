This audit involved a survey of staff experience of sexual harassment in local government. It was designed to be comparable to the Victorian Public Service People Matters Survey and includes an interactive dashboard that allows the public to explore and understand the survey results.

[The report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/sexual-harassment-local-government?) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 9 December 2020.
